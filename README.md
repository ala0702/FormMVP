# FormMVP

Basic form with MVP architecture

## Description

The FormMVP project is a sample desktop application created in C# using the MVP (Model-View-Presenter) architecture. The application includes a basic form that demonstrates how to organize code according to the MVP architecture, making it easier to maintain and expand the project.

## Architecture

The FormMVP project follows the MVP architecture, which divides the application into three main components:

- Model: The model layer contains the business logic and data representation.
- View: The view layer is responsible for displaying the user interface and capturing events.
- Presenter: The presenter layer acts as a mediator between the model layer and the view layer, controlling the business logic and responding to user actions.

## Requirements

- .NET Framework
